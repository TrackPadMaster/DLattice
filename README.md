# Lattice-Simulations
One dimensional lattice, outputs average temperature given intensity and gamma


This project is coded in Fortran 90, though there will be remnants from 77.
MPICH is a necessity for running this.
I'll have another sub-section somewhere for downloading and installing that.

Remember that before running Fortran code, it will need to actually be compiled on your machine.
I bring this up because some of my machines compile slightly differently, despite being the same?

Once the code is compiled, you can run some of the shell scripts to make the whole process much less tedious.
