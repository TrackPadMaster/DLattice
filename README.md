# Lattice-Simulations
One dimensional lattice, outputs average temperature given intensity and detuning


This project is coded in Fortran 90, though there will be remnants from 77.
The current working version will NOT include MPICH, since this is such a fast project anyways.
A future goal might be to include it to run multiple detunings at the same time.

Remember that before running Fortran code, it will need to actually be compiled on your machine.
I bring this up because some of my machines compile slightly differently, despite being the same?

Once the code is compiled, you can run some of the shell scripts to make the whole process much less tedious.
